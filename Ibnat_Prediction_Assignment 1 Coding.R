#Build four predictive models using linear regression for earnings per hour.
    #  1.Models: the target variable is earnings per hour, all others would be predictors.
    #  2.Model 1 shall be the simplest, model 4 the more complex. It shall be OLS. You shall explain your choice of predictors.
    #  3.Compare model performance of these models (a) RMSE in the full sample, (2) cross-validated RMSE and (c) BIC in the full sample.
    #  4.Discuss the relationship between model complexity and performance. You may use visual aids.

# Model 4: Adding Non-Linear Terms & Interactions 
model4_combined <- lm(w ~ age + female + grade92 + uhours + I(age^2) + female:age, data = combined_data)

## Choice of Predictors
# To build predictive models for earnings per hour, I selected the following predictors:
   # Age: Earnings often increase with experience, making age a natural predictor.
   # Gender (Sex): Studies suggest potential gender-based earnings differences in the entertainment industry.
   # Education (Grade92): Higher education levels often lead to better earnings opportunities.
   # Work Hours (Uhours): Including work hours allows us to measure true hourly wage differences.
   # Non-Linear Terms (AgeÂ²): Many careers exhibit an earnings peak at middle age.
   # Interaction (Age Ã— Sex): The effect of age on earnings may differ by gender.

## Using the RMSE, Cross-Validated RMSE, and BIC graphs that I generated, the trends shows:
  # RMSE Graph â†’ Shows that adding more predictors improves accuracy (Model 4 is best).
      # The RMSE graph shows a clear improvement from Model 1 to Model 4.
      # Lower RMSE = better prediction accuracy.
      # Model 4 is the best in terms of RMSE.
  # Cross-Validation RMSE Graph â†’ Confirms Model 4 generalizes better than simpler models.
      # It confirms RMSE trends, meaning Model 4 performs best on new data.
      # The difference is small, but Model 4 still wins.
  # BIC Graph â†’ Shows that increasing complexity raises BIC, meaning a trade-off exists.
      # Model 1 has the lowest BIC, meaning it's the simplest.
      # Model 4 has the highest BIC, suggesting it may be too complex.
